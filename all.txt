Slide 1: Strategy Overview
Title: Harvesting Alpha in China ETFs via Aggregated NLP Signals
Objective: Transforming micro-level textual data (Broker Disclosures & Earnings Calls) into macro-level signals for Sector ETFs.

Core Thesis: In the Chinese market, institutional sentiment and management guidance often "lead" price action in sectors like Technology (CSI 500/Semi), Consumer, and Green Energy.

Data Integration:

Internal View: Earnings Call Transcripts (Corporate Guidance).

External View: Broker Disclosures (Sell-side Sentiment).

Slide 2: Methodology – The Aggregation FrameworkHeadline: From Single-Stock Features to Index-Level SignalsWeighting Logic: Unlike individual stocks, ETF signals must be calculated using Index Weighting.$S_{ETF} = \sum (w_i \times S_i)$ where $w_i$ is the constituent weight and $S_i$ is the linguistic score.Key Metrics to Monitor:Sentiment Dispersion: A high standard deviation in sentiment across a sector indicates "Internal Divergence"—often a precursor to high volatility.Hard Info Density: Measuring the ratio of Numbers/Statistics to Total Word Count to filter "fluff" from factual guidance.
------------
Slide 3: Signal A – The "Forward-Looking" ReboundHeadline: Anticipating Sector Inflection Points via Tense AnalysisThe Signal: Identify ETFs where Future-Tense Frequency is rising while Past-Tense Frequency (and current price) remains depressed.Market Context: In China, sectors often trade on "Policy Expectations." Management increasing the use of future tense signals a shift in operational strategy or upcoming policy tailwinds.Trading Action: * Long: If $\frac{\text{Future Tense}}{\text{Past Tense}} > \text{2-year Moving Average}$ and price is in a drawdown.Logic: Capturing the "Bottoming Out" phase before it reflects in the P&L.
------------
Slide 4: Signal B – The "Obfuscation" Red Flag
Headline: Detecting Speculative Bubbles vs. Fundamental Growth

The Signal: A decoupling between Word Count and Hard Info (Numbers).

The "Hiding" Pattern:

When management or brokers use increased sentence complexity and longer word counts but fewer digits/metrics, it often indicates a lack of concrete progress.

Application: Short or Underweight ETFs where "Linguistic Complexity" rises without a corresponding increase in "Numerical Density."

Risk Mitigation: This signal acts as a "Speculation Filter" for high-beta sectors like AI or Biotech.
--------------
Slide 5: Signal C – Sentiment & Flow Divergence
Headline: Counter-Intuitive Signals from Broker Disclosure

The "China Subtext" Factor: In the Chinese brokerage industry, "Neutral" or "Hold" ratings are rare. A drop in Sentiment Score (even if still positive) is often a "Hidden Sell" signal.

Divergence Analysis:

Bullish Convergence: Increasing Broker Sentiment + Increasing Numerical Mentions = High Conviction Buy.

Bearish Divergence: Peak Broker Sentiment + Decreasing Numerical Mentions = Exit/Take Profit.
