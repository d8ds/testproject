Summary
I've created a complete AutoGen-based system for analyzing Glassdoor reviews to generate trading signals. Here's what you have:
Core Components:

Multi-Agent System (glassdoor_trading_system.py):

DataAnalyst: Statistical analysis of review data
SentimentAnalyst: Sentiment trends and theme detection
SignalGenerator: Converts insights to trading signals
RiskManager: Validates signals and assesses risks
Orchestrator: Coordinates the workflow


Database Layer (database_setup.py):

SQLite schema for reviews and signals
Sample data generation for testing
Signal storage and retrieval utilities


System Runner (system_runner.py):

Interactive command-line interface
Batch processing capabilities
System monitoring and health checks
Configuration management



Key Features:

Agent Collaboration: Uses AutoGen's GroupChat for structured agent interactions
Data Processing: Analyzes multiple review dimensions (ratings, sentiment, trends)
Signal Generation: Produces BUY/SELL/HOLD signals with confidence scores
Risk Management: Built-in validation and risk assessment
Persistence: Stores signals and tracks performance over time

Usage Options:
bash# Quick demo
python system_runner.py demo

# Interactive mode
python system_runner.py interactive  

# Analyze specific company
python system_runner.py analyze AAPL

# Full market scan
python system_runner.py scan
Next Steps:

Set up environment: Install requirements and set OpenAI API key
Run setup: python database_setup.py to create sample data
Test system: python system_runner.py demo
Customize agents: Modify system messages for your specific analysis needs
Integrate real data: Replace sample data with actual Glassdoor reviews

The system is designed to be modular and extensible. You can easily modify agent behaviors, add new analysis dimensions, or integrate with trading platforms.
