Excellent question! Your signals naturally form a hierarchical narrative from surface-level to deep behavioral patterns. Here's how to organize them into a compelling story:

Narrative Framework: "Peeling the Onion"
The story arc moves from what's visible → what's meaningful → what's hidden → what reveals true behavior

Act 1: Surface Level - "What We See First"
Signal 1: Document Length (Context)
The Starting Point
Slide Title: "The Obvious Signal: Document Length"
The Intuition:

Longer 8-Ks suggest complexity, uncertainty, or attempting to bury bad news
Shorter 8-Ks suggest straightforward events or management confidence

Show Results:

Basic performance metrics (probably modest IC ~0.02-0.03)
Quintile analysis showing some spread

The Problem (Plant the Seed):
"But wait—not all words are created equal. A 5,000-word filing could be:

Dense with meaningful information, OR
Padded with boilerplate and legal jargon"

The Transition: "So we asked: What if we filter for quality?"

Act 2: Content Quality - "Separating Signal from Noise"
Signal 2: Filtered Length (Content)
The Refinement
Slide Title: "Beyond Word Count: Quality-Adjusted Length"
The Method:

Sentence quality filtering (remove boilerplate, legal disclaimers, low-information sentences)
Focus on substantive content only

The Reveal:

Show side-by-side performance: Raw length vs Filtered length
Demonstrate improvement (IC improvement from 0.02 → 0.04, for example)
"Filtering noise improved signal quality by 2x"

The Insight:

"Management can inflate word count easily. But they can't fake substantive content. Quality-adjusted length reveals information density, not just verbosity."

The Bridge to Next Level:
"But even quality content can be organized differently. How information is structured matters..."

Act 3: Structural Complexity - "How Information is Organized"
Signal 3: Section/Item Count (Finer-Grained Info)
The Architectural View
Slide Title: "Document Architecture: Section Complexity as Signal"
The Concept:

Number of sections/items disclosed
Structural complexity vs simplicity
Information organization reveals cognitive load or obfuscation intent

The Hypotheses:

More sections = Multiple simultaneous events OR attempting to fragment attention
Fewer sections = Focused disclosure OR cleaner event
Section diversity = Cross-sectional complexity in business changes

Show Results:

Performance metrics
Maybe show interaction effects: "Long documents with few sections" vs "Long documents with many sections"

The Key Finding:

"Two companies file the same length document. One uses 3 sections, one uses 8. The 8-section filer underperforms by 40bps over the next month. Why? Structural complexity signals information uncertainty or deliberate obfuscation."

The Transition:
"So far we've analyzed what they file and how they structure it. But there's another dimension: when they file..."

Act 4: Behavioral Metadata - "What They Don't Say Directly"
Signal 4: Filing Delay (Meta Data)
The Behavioral Reveal
Slide Title: "The Delay Signal: When Silence Speaks"
The Setup:

4-day deadline for 8-K filing
Management chooses when within that window to file
Delay = time from event to filing

The Behavioral Interpretation:
Fast filing (Day 0-1):

Confidence in message
Desire for rapid disclosure
Positive or neutral news

Slow filing (Day 3-4):

Need for careful wording
Legal/PR consultation
Negative or complex news

Show the Performance:

Quintile analysis by delay
Probably strong monotonic relationship
Maybe show that delay predicts both direction AND magnitude of price movement

The Power:

"This is pure behavioral signal. Management reveals their confidence (or lack thereof) through their actions, not their words. Delay is the ultimate truth serum—it's much harder to fake than text."

Additional Insight (if applicable):

Combine with day-of-week patterns (Friday evening filings = bad news burial)
Interaction with market conditions (delaying during earnings season)


Act 5: The Integration - "From Individual Signals to Behavioral Fingerprint"
Signal 5: The Composite Story
Bringing It All Together
Slide Title: "Four Dimensions of Disclosure Behavior"
Visual: A Framework Diagram
DISCLOSURE BEHAVIOR FINGERPRINT

Surface Layer:        Volume (Length)
                           ↓
Content Layer:        Quality (Filtered Length)  
                           ↓
Structural Layer:     Complexity (Section Count)
                           ↓
Behavioral Layer:     Timing (Filing Delay)
The Integration Hypothesis:
"These signals capture orthogonal dimensions of management behavior"
Show Correlation Matrix:
                Length  Filtered  Sections  Delay
Length           1.00    0.75      0.35     0.15
Filtered         0.75    1.00      0.28     0.12
Sections         0.35    0.28      1.00     0.08
Delay            0.15    0.12      0.08     1.00
The Key Insight:

"Low correlation means each signal adds unique information. A company can file quickly (low delay) but use complex structure (high sections)—each tells us something different about their state."


Act 6: Point vs Delta vs Rolling - The Temporal Dimension
Slide Title: "From Events to Patterns: The Aggregation Breakthrough"
Now Apply Your Temporal Finding:
For EACH signal type, show:

Point-based (current filing only)
Delta-based (change vs previous)
Rolling-based (pattern over time)

Create a Heat Map or Matrix:
                    Point    Delta    Rolling
Length              0.02     0.03     0.06
Filtered Length     0.03     0.04     0.07
Section Count       0.02     0.02     0.05
Filing Delay        0.04     0.04     0.08
(These are example ICs)
The Universal Truth:

"Across ALL signal types, rolling aggregation dominates. Why? Because we're not trading on single events—we're trading on management disclosure behavior, which is a persistent trait."

The Examples:
Point-based thinking:
"This company filed late" → Noisy, could be one-off
Delta-based thinking:
"This company filed later than last time" → Better, but still reactive
Rolling-based thinking:
"This company has been consistently filing late for 6 months" → Pattern, behavioral trait
